# Step 1:  Take a variable of value 8
first_number = 8

# Step 2: Take a second variable of value 10
second_number = 10

# Step 3: Calculate the sum of all the four numbers and save it in a new variable named as sum of numbers
sum_of_numbers = first_number + second_number 

# Step 4: Now command the system to give the output of the sum of numbers
print(sum_of_numbers)
