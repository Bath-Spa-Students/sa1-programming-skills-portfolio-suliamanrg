# Step 1:  Take a variable of value 10
first_number = 10

# Step 2: Take a second variable of value 15
second_number = 15

# Step 3: Take a third variable of value 20
third_number = 20

# Step 4: Take a fourth variable of value 25
forth_number = 25

# Step 5: Calculate the sum of all the four numbers and save it in a new variable named as sum of numbers
sum_of_numbers = first_number + second_number + third_number + forth_number

# Step 6: Now command the system to give the output of the sum of numbers
print("The sum of", first_number, second_number, third_number, "and", forth_number, "is:", sum_of_numbers)
